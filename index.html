      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>
        I am a self-taught programmer and Linux administrator. I started
        programming at 13 with BASIC, and have taught myself multiple languages
        such as: <em>C</em>, <em>C#</em>, <em>Objective-C</em>,
        <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em> and <em>Java</em>. My current
        favorite language is JavaScript. It clearly has idosyncracies, but I
        really enjoy the flexibility of the prototypal inheritance and first
        class functions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of JavaScript, the language I work in the most lately is Java.
        Dealing with an Oracle database is much easier in Java than other
        languages, and the programs I write at work require such. I do like the
        strong typing of Java, though. It’s nice to have the guarantee that data
        will conform to a predefined structure. Still, I tend to have more fun in
        a weakly typed language like JavaScript.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I started getting into Linux when I was 17 or 18. I believe I started
        with SuSE 5.2, but the first distribution I really spent significant time
        with was Debian 2.1 (Slink). By the time Debian 3.0 (Woody) was released,
        I was using Linux full-time as my desktop operating system. Nowadays, I
        manage many Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers, for which I build barebones
        kickstart profiles and package RPMs as necessary.

      <h2 id="ideal-position">Ideal Position</h2>
      
      <p>
        While my most developed skill set is in the Linux administration domain,
        my ideal position would be on a small(ish) team doing interesting web
        development. I would love to work with a designer, or two, implementing
        their ideas in a Node.js environment. I’d like to work from home most
        days, but gather with the team at least a couple times per month for
        in-person collaborative work.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I think it would also be fun to work on phone applications.
        Specifically, iOS applications. I’d love to get back into Objective-C or
        even Apple’s new language, Swift (I’ve played with it and it’s rather
        nice).

      <p>
        Listed here are a few highlights of open source projects I have created,
        or contributed to, in my free time:

          <strong>Goji</strong>
          <span class="ospl">

          </span>
        </p>
        
        <div class="ospd">
          <p>
            <em>Goji</em> is a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> template
            engine for HTML documents. It was inspired by the Java HTML template
            engine <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this project because I couldn’t find a template engine for
            Node.js that I liked. I wanted a template language that is fully
            legitimate HTML.
