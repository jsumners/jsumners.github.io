      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        I am a self-taught programmer and Linux administrator with a B.Sc. in
        Mathematics. I started programming around age 13 (~1992) with BASIC,
        and have taught myself multiple languages such as: <em>C</em>, <em>C#</em>,
        <em>Objective-C</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em> and
        <em>Java</em>. My current favorite language is JavaScript. I like the
        flexibility of the prototypal inheritance and first class functions.
        I have also been spending more time with <em>Go</em>, and quite like
        its approach to things.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy working on Open Source Software. I am a core
        maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/pinojs/pino">Pino</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fastify">Fastify</a>, and the lead
        maintainer
        of <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs">ldapjs</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of software development, my various hobbies include bicycling,
        music production, and video games.

      <p>
        I like building tooling and frameworks that help developers get their
        work done. I also enjoy building core services that facilitate
        integrating internal data and services, as well as to integrate
        external third party services and data.

      <p>
        Listed here are a few highlights of open source projects I have created,
        or contributed to, in my free time:

      <div class="osp">
        <p>
          <strong>Pino</strong>
          <span class="ospl">
            [<a href="https://github.com/pinojs/pino">github</a>]
            ~ [JavaScript]

            <em>Pino</em> is a logging library for Node.js. It was developed
            to be a very fast logger so that applications can spend less time
            on logging and more time on their actual work.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was made a maintainer of the project in September of 2016. I came
            to Pino because I was annoyed with other loggers in the ecosystem
            and was researching whether or not I should write my own. Luckily,
            Pino had the exact feature set I was looking for. I liked Pino so
            much that I submitted fixes to filed issues, and submitted my own
            improvements. These actions are how I earned maintainership.

        <div class="ospd">
          <p>
            <em>Fastify</em> is a developer friendly Node.js HTTP framework that
            is also extremely performant.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was made a maintainer of the project in September of 2017. I came
            to Fastify by way of my work in Pino. I noticed that Matteo, an
            original author and maintainer of Pino, was working on a new HTTP
            framework. At the time, I was working with Hapi but the work
            being done in Fastify intriguied me. So, much as with Pino, I
            started submitting pull requests to solve issues on the framework
            that interested me, which led to me becoming a member of the team.

            <em>JSCAS</em> is an implementation of Apereo's

          </p>
          <p>
            I created this project because I need to run a CAS environment, but
            I find the reference implementation cumbersome. The goal with this
            project is to make it as easy to use and extend as possible, while
            adhering to the protocol specification.

          <p>
            I was made a maintainer of this project in November of 2014. I
            spearheaded moving the project from SourceForge to GitHub, in an
            effort to make it more attractive to new contributors, and
            reorganized the structure of the project's source files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to becoming a maintainer, I had contributed patches to
            implement JSONP support. I had also monitored the SourceForge
            forums and helped others learn the library.

            Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and similar distributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my own fork of work previously started by another
            individual. I greatly overhauled the build script to perform the
            build within an environment totally maintained by the build
            script. I also added in building the Tomcat Native library and
            bundling it into the RPM. Finally, I added JSVC to the generated
            RPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result of my work on the project means that generating a custom
            Tomcat package with all the bells and whistles is as simple as
            running:
