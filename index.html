      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        I am a self-taught programmer and Linux administrator with a B.Sc. in
        Mathematics. I started programming around age 13 (~1992) with BASIC,
        and have taught myself multiple languages such as: <em>C</em>, <em>C#</em>,
        <em>Objective-C</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em> and
        <em>Java</em>. My current favorite language is JavaScript. It clearly
        has idiosyncracies, but I really enjoy the flexibility of the prototypal
        inheritance and first class functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of JavaScript, the language I work in the most lately is Java.
        Dealing with an Oracle database is much easier in Java than other
        languages, and the programs I write at work require such. I do like the
        strong typing of Java, though. It’s nice to have the guarantee that data
        will conform to a predefined structure. Still, I tend to have more fun in
        a weakly typed language like JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started getting into Linux when I was 17 or 18. I believe I started
        with SuSE 5.2, but the first distribution I really spent significant time
        with was Debian 2.1 (Slink). By the time Debian 3.0 (Woody) was released,
        I was using Linux full-time as my desktop operating system. Nowadays, I
        manage many Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers, for which I build barebones
        kickstart profiles and package RPMs as necessary.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ideal-position">Ideal Position</h2>

      <p>
        While my most developed skill set is in the Linux administration domain,
        my ideal position would be on a small(ish) team doing interesting web
        development. I would love to work with a designer, or two, implementing
        their ideas in a Node.js environment. If possible, I'd like for the
        position to include regular, or mostly, telecommute days.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it would also be fun to work on phone applications.
        Specifically, iOS applications. I’d love to get back into Objective-C or
        even Apple’s new language, Swift (I’ve played with it and it’s rather
        nice).
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I understand that ideals are few and far between. So I'm not
        holding out for this exact position. I am open to a variety of other
        positions.

      <h2 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h2>

      <p>
        Listed here are a few highlights of open source projects I have created,
        or contributed to, in my free time:
      </p>

      <div class="osp">
        <p>
          <strong>JSCAS</strong>
          <span class="ospl">
            [<a href="https://github.com/jscas">github</a>]
            ~ [JavaScript]
          </span>
        </p>

        <div class="ospd">
          <p>
            <em>JSCAS</em> is an implementation of Apereo's
            <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">Central Authentication
              Service</a> (CAS) written in JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this project because I need to run a CAS environment, but
            I find the reference implementation cumbersome. The goal with this
            project is to make it as easy to use and extend as possible, while
            adhering to the protocol specification.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="osp">

          <strong>Crypto Util</strong>
          <span class="ospl">

        </p>

        <div class="ospd">
          <p>
            <em>Crypto Util</em> is library that wraps the native JDK
            cryptography functions making them easier to use. It provides
            easy to use classes and methods for common scenarios. It also
            provides a simple interface for using uncommon algorightms.

      <div class="osp">

          <span class="ospl">

            ~ [PL/SQL]

        </p>

        <div class="ospd">
          <p>
            <em>PL/JSON</em> is a set of Oracle PL types and packages that
            provide JSON support to the Oracle PL language.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was made a maintainer of this project in November of 2014. I
            spearheaded moving the project from SourceForge to GitHub, in an
            effort to make it more attractive to new contributors, and
            reorganized the structure of the project's source files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to becoming a maintainer, I had contributed patches to
            implement JSONP support. I had also monitored the SourceForge
            forums and helped others learn the library.

        <div class="ospd">

            <em>Thymeleaf Layout Interceptor</em> is a

        <div class="ospd">

            <em>Tomcat RPM</em> is a project that simplifies building a
            <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> package for
            Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and similar distributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my own fork of work previously started by another
            individual. I greatly overhauled the build script to perform the
            build within an environment totally maintained by the build
            script. I also added in building the Tomcat Native library and
            bundling it into the RPM. Finally, I added JSVC to the generated
            RPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result of my work on the project means that generating a custom
            Tomcat package with all the bells and whistles is as simple as
            running:
